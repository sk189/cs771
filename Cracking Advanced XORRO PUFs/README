ML FOR CYBER SECURITY

We solved the binary classification techniques to solve the linear models for different PUFs.

For every 64-bit PUF, there exists 𝐰∈ℝ^𝟔𝟒,𝑏∈ℝ so that the response of that PUF to any 64-bit challenge can be predicted simply by encoding that challenge as a 64-dimensional vector 𝐱 and applying the linear model 𝐰^⊤ 𝐱+𝑏
